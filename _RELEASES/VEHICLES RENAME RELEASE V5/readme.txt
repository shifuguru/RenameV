[Info]
English support only.

Updated for patch 3411

This mod will likely require updating every patch, sorry if it takes me a while to update.
=ε/̵͇̿̿/’̿’̿ ̿ (˵ ͡° ͜ʖ ͡°˵)  ===> 

Ensure you keep a backup of your ~vehicles.meta~ file, especially if you have made your own edits. Feel free to edit the values, they're just ordered. I wanted to add RDE support, but just install their vehicles.meta and make the Brand Name changes shown in the Manual Changes file.


The provided ~vehicles.meta~ file also adds brands that don't exist in Vanilla GTA and require my A_Global dlcpack to provide the Vehicle Brands. The game will very likely crash if you do not add my dlcpack.


IMPORTANT: Backup your vehicles.meta file, in case you have previously edited it for modded vehicles, dashboards, wheel sizes etc.

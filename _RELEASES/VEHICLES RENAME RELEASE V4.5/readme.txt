[Info]
English support only at this stage!

Updated for patch 3095

This mod will likely require updating every patch     =ε/̵͇̿̿/’̿’̿ ̿ (˵ ͡° ͜ʖ ͡°˵)  ===> 

Ensure you keep a backup of your ~vehicles.meta~ file, especially if you have made your own edits. Feel free to edit the values, they're just ordered . 

The provided ~vehicles.meta~ file also adds brands that don't exist in Vanilla GTA and required my A_Global dlcpack to provide the Vehicle Brands . 

The changes are much more accurate than other mods I've tested, hopefully you enjoy it 


[Installation]

0. Use OpenIV and enable Edit Mode (F6):

Navigate to the following folders and drag/drop to add/replace files from their respective folders: 

1. ..\mods\update\update.rpf\common\data\levels\gta5\

2. ..\mods\update\update2.rpf\x64\data\lang\american_rel.rpf\ 
- Replace GLOBAL.GXT


3. ..\mods\update\x64\dlcpacks\

4. ..\mods\update\update.rpf\common\data\

b. Add to end of list before </Paths>:  
<Item>dlcpacks:/A_Global/</Item>

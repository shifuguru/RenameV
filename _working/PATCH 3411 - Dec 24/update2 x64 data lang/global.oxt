Turns out organic pet food is totally recession proof! But it was never about the money for me, even when I floated the business on the stock exchange, and I'm totally unchanged by it. I'm a new generation of millionaire. I don't believe in cynicism or working hard. Money is meaningless if you're spiritually bereft, you know what I mean? When you stepped in and helped me, you didn't see a highly successful entrepreneur.  You just saw a young, cool guy who got his bike stolen. And that's awesome, dude. So check this out.  I'm sending you $100,000 of stock in Animal Ark. That way, I'm invested in you, you're invested in me.  Sound cool?

It's not the car that matters – I am insured after all – as much as the fact that you stopped to help a person in need.  My family came to the USA 20 years ago with $50 to our name and, thanks to a little hard work and a lot of ruthless business tactics, we now run a very successful tailoring business with supply contracts at many of the high-end department stores, including Givenchy.   All too often these days, the American Dream is reserved not for those who love thy neighbor but for those who stab thy neighbor in the back, which leads me to believe that you're probably not a rich man.  Plus I really need to get my karma back on track so, as a small token of my gratitude, I have sent one of our top-selling men's suits to your house.  If it doesn't fit, remember it's the thought that counts.  Take care,Saeeda~nrt~

Her father Harold worked as a plucker in the local chicken farm, her mother Eileen as a slopper at the local dairy farm, so it's safe to assume that her expectations for life were set fairly low – a sloppy plucker, or some other rural thing. A sickly child, she suffered chest problems for many years, mostly as a result of the heavy smoking so in vogue at the time. Leonora was a quiet, unremarkable student whom one of her teachers described as "the kind of early physical developer and late mental developer that got a lot of attention from older boys and certain faculty members".<br><br>At the encouragement of her uncle – or possibly to get away from him – Leonora left school at 15 and hitched her way to Los Angeles with dreams of becoming a movie star or model. After working as a waitress for a few months, it didn't take long for Leonora's childlike naiveté and stunning good looks to catch the eye of wolfish entertainment industry types, and she soon became a common face on the Hollywood party circuit and the casting couch circuit.<br><br>By the early 1970s, she was getting regular work in print ads, television commercials and minor movie roles. After a scene-stealing turn as a wise-cracking disabled prostitute in the 1973 film 'Rum Runner', the Los Angeles Shepherd described her as "a pretty face to watch without perhaps much spark in the eyes" and shortly before her death she was allegedly a frontrunner for a leading female role in 'The Many Wives of Alfredo Smith'. Who knows how bright her future could have been if that pretty face hadn't been severed from her perfect body...

The most powerful tool of all is the tool of manifest generosity towards ideas, and towards the upward. That is, sometimes a peach tree issues forth fire and a great dove becomes born.<BR>That dove is money and the money should be spent by all to achieve manifest generosity, as each paradigm has shown those who understood. And manifest generosity is the god head and being the god head is the movement towards truth form. Truth form is important but it is difficult for the wrong to understand, so ask yourself, am I the right?<BR>And I prove that through my adherence to manifest generosity and by the Eagle and the dove and the peach tree and upward gravity and by understanding, above all, this manifest truth form? Yea, to some this will seem hard to understand but it will be revealed, and to some it will seem hard to understand and it will not be revealed because they did not seek truly because they were the wrong form of bird or topiary. If you seek wisdom, you will pay for it and seeking and paying are the same thing as is understanding, if you want it to be.

You are being controlled by lots of powerful forces you do not understand - like gravity. Just as an apple sometimes flies up from a tree and becomes a great Eagle, so what seems like greed can in its own way be the most selfless act of all.<BR>The act of loving only one, the god head, is the act of loving all, the people as god head. That is clear to those who seek, and seek we must and pay we must. Seeking without paying is not living, it is living on the cheap.<BR>Epsilonism is an expensive religion. Only for those with the wisdom to afford it. Wisdom is our most valuable commodity and that is why we pay highly for it.

In the 6th paradigm it was the love of ignorance and the Eagle.<BR>In the 7th it was the great dispute in which Unsaveables learnt to take the form of conflicted reason. In the 8th, it was amnesia. In this 9th it is within the being form – that is the red, and he with red and of red in the hair form is not of Kraff and he is the embodiment of that which is Unsaveable. All of these paradigms will be revealed to you through upwards generosity. Their meaning shall be made clear as your role in the great battles will be made clear.

	EMSTR_194 = Dear Michael,Very good seeing you yesterday. I want to stress how important it is that we continue therapy.~nrt~ We are on the point of a major breakthrough in your treatment. It's a fascinating process. When it seems pointless and exploitative is when therapy works the most! Life isn't meaningless. You're deeply troubled but together we can make you a functioning member of society. I recommends you keep taking the medication, continue to read the books I gave you and really try to understand what is causing these temper outbursts.  We'll crack you yet, amigo! We're in this together. As you know, I really enjoy working together – you're a fascinating man, Michael, but I'm afraid medicine in this country is not a charity, and with that in mind, I am afraid I am going to put my rates up again. Only by 75% which I think is very reasonable, given the stresses and strains of my work. Yours.~nrt~

Fabien is so annoying. If I wanted to do yoga I'd like go to India or something. And he keeps asking me to cal him dad... only joking! See, I do have a sense of humor. My singing and dancing are going well but I'm really pissed that you screwed up fame or shame 4 me. Your such a dick.  Jimmy is useless. I wonder how him and I could come from the same place? was mom doing coke again when she was pregnant with me? Joke (or is it???!?)Anyway, we are all fine. Don't get a divorce. That would suck.

Please stop cheating on me, please stop hanging out with those people and please stop getting into the kind of trouble you're getting into. Go back to being the fat, depressing slob in therapy I loved! Okay, be the best you! That's what they say on Listen In. So do it. Or do something positive. Set an example to the kids. A better example. Listen, I REALLY think we should remodel the house again. Nothing expensive. What they call a 'quick gut' – it should really solidify our relationship. Either that or get a beach house. Think you find the sea very calming. xox~nrt~

A word of goodbye would have been nice. Well, so you aware, I've been to the desert to get certified as a pelvic floor exercise instructor. I have been weak down there for so long. Well, no longer. Now I am strong and I will lead. And you are weak. Not just as a man, but as a person. You're really losing yourself, and I don't like it. You ain't got no respect. What if I want to put a women's Arts Center in the home? What if I want to start running pelvic floor classes myself there? Well as I always say, you come from trash, you stay trash and that's what you is, boy. I loved my sister, but boy did she make some mistakes, including in having you.

	EMSTR_352 = Hello,You don't know me but we shared a moment of extreme and visceral intimacy.  I'm the woman whose life you saved from that crazy man outside the gas station.~nrt~  You're probably wondering how I found you.  Don't.  There's a threshold of wealth beyond which anything becomes possible.  My husband is the CEO of Starbucks Coffee, the man who came up with the genius idea of turning coffee into junk food.  You did such a brave and selfless act and I wanted to do something equally brave and selfless in return.  However, after a lot of soul-searching, I have come up empty.  I think I've just been too rich for too long to quantify things in any other terms.  I was going to offer you free coffee for life but it tastes like burnt bath water and, let's face it, you'd probably prefer the money.  But what is a life worth?  What is a billionaire's life worth?  According to my husband, "low six figures".  So, by the time you read this email, you should be in the possession of $100,000 of Starbucks Coffee stock.  I trust you will find this to be adequate compensation and will never approach me or my family again.  Best,Eileen~nrt~

It's not the car that matters – I am insured after all – as much as the fact that you stopped to help a person in need.  My family came to the USA 20 years ago with $50 to our name and, thanks to a little hard work and a lot of ruthless business tactics, we now run a very successful tailoring business with supply contracts at many of the high-end department stores, including Givenchy.   All too often these days, the American Dream is reserved not for those who love thy neighbor but for those who stab thy neighbor in the back, which leads me to believe that you're probably not a rich man.  Plus I really need to get my karma back on track so, as a small token of my gratitude, I have sent one of our top-selling men's suits to your house.  If it doesn't fit, remember it's the thought that counts.  Take care,Saeeda~nrt~

I agree whole heartedly with you – my actions were a little inhumane. But that's not a bad thing. Inhumanity is the very watchword, the very currency, the very life blood of the artist! My inhumanity makes me human. It's thanks to my inhumanity that I'm able to speak to people with the moral authority of the sinner and the creator, all at once. I had to kill her. And I had to do it in that way. The way that would hurt me most – by torturing her slowly and painfully, then sending momentos from our date to her family.

I only do it to experience it so my art is truer, deeper, more meaningful, and I believe you know that.~n~~n~I cannot wait for you to read my new draft of LEARED. I have really removed the cliches that ruined Shakespeare's plays and found the power, the moment, the thing we talked about that wonderful night in Mexico when we paid the hookers to stab each other.
	LETTERS_PAGE_TWO = And in the years since, I've had to, at times, goad her family into further suffering. Just to prove how very much I understand suffering and how I can represent it best as an artist – isn't it better that one family suffers so the world can be free to enjoy, to learn and to be cleansed by my masterpieces? Don't even bother answering that. The answer is obvious and if you get it wrong, well, then you're less of a man than I thought.~n~~n~But let us not concern ourselves with such trivialities – we are artists, my friend. The last of a dying breed. I dread the day when you finally retire and Solomon takes over – sure I love the kid but he's a remorseless hack with none of your passion, your creative zeal.

The Releases tab are only updated every time I am creating a new update to upload to gta5-mods.com, technically it is a misnomer because the 'latest' patch version in the folder may not be ready for release just yet and is a working directory for when I do release the mod.
It goes without saying that these files are currently in development and to take caution with them, that being said I normally only upload to GitHub once I confirm the version is working, but mistakes do happen! 

Now for installation, 

I recommendd installing an official release of the mod from gta5-mods.com, then overwrite with the files for your game version from the _working folder.

<b>[RENAMEV]</b><br>
A Truly Authentic Vehicle Names Overhaul with Real Life Locations Included<br>
Changes brands and locations to their Real Life counterparts


<b>[DISCLAIMER]</b><br>
I'm going to assume that by you finding this location you are a Pro-Modder and do not require assistance with debugging mods.<br>
However, it goes without saying that these files are currently **in development** and to take caution when installing them.<br>
With that being said I try to push updates once I've confirmed that version is working, but mistakes do happen!<br>
**It's a pretty simple mod but some vehicles.meta files have been known to crash the game:**

<b>[CURRENT BUGS]</b><br>
<b>March 2025</b><br>
**patch 3411**, avoid this currently or use the <b>manual method</b> included in its archive!<br>
Issues related to the file size or something, haven't quite worked out the issue.<br>
Also the A_global dlcpack has a vehicles.meta file in it that I am trying to overwrite the dlcpatch folder vehicles.meta file values with, feel free to help me get it working by changing values in the content.xml file: <br>
<b>dlcpacks/A_global/dlc.rpf/content.xml</b>

<br>

<b>[INSTALLATION]</b><br>
<b>[LEGACY]</b><br>
Install an <a href="https://www.gta5-mods.com/misc/replaced-game-names">Official Release</a> version of the mod.<br>
Download the desired Patch Version from the <b>__working/LEGACY</b> folder.<br>
Copy le pasta!

<b>[ENHANCED]</b><br>
Updates are pending Modding Support for the game. I'm not going to pretend or assume the mod works and I'd like to focus on Legacy first, give it a proper send off!<br>
From what I see there were no huge changes to how the mod will work, but with split versions it may get trickier to manage, and updates for Legacy may take longer as priority drops, since I will definitely be moving onto Enhanced GTA 5 once modding support arrives for it, and deleting the game after most of my must-have mods are transferred.

<b>[RENAMEV]</b>

<b>[DISCLAIMER]</b><br>
The Releases are intended to be updated every time I am getting an upload ready for gta5-mods.com, technically it is a misnomer because the latest version in the folder may not be ready for public release just yet as it is simply a working directory for when I do release the mod.
<br>
It goes without saying that these files are currently in development and to take caution with them, that being said I normally only upload to GitHub once I confirm the version is working, but mistakes do happen! 

<br>

Now for installation, 

I recommendd installing an <a href="https://www.gta5-mods.com/misc/replaced-game-names">official release</a> of the mod before installing the files for your game version, from the <b>_working</b> folder.<br>

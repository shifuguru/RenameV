<b>[DISCLAIMER]</b><br>
I'm going to assume that by you finding this location you are a Pro-Modder and do not require assistance with debugging mods.<br>
However, it goes without saying that these files are currently **in development** and to take caution when installing them.<br>
With that being said I try to push updates once I've confirmed that version is working, but mistakes do happen!<br>
**It's a pretty simple mod but some vehicles.meta files have been known to crash the game:**

<b>[CURRENT BUGS]</b><br>
<b>March 2025</b><br>
**patch 3411**, do not use the current upload of update.rpf/../vehicles.meta<br> 
Use <b>manual.txt</b> to update your vehicles.meta file manually<br>
<b>If you use RDE, the RDE vehicles.meta is currently working fine!</b><br>

<b>[INSTALLATION]</b><br>
<b>[LEGACY]</b><br>
Install an <a href="https://www.gta5-mods.com/misc/replaced-game-names">Official Release</a> version of the mod.<br>
Download the desired Patch Version from the <b>__working/LEGACY</b> folder.<br>
Copy le pasta!

<b>[ENHANCED]</b><br>
Updates are pending Modding Support for the game. I'm not going to pretend or assume the mod works and I'd like to focus on Legacy first, give it a proper send off!<br>
From what I see there were no huge changes to how the mod will work, but with split versions it may get trickier to manage, and updates for Legacy may take longer as priority drops, since I will definitely be moving onto Enhanced GTA 5 once modding support arrives for it, and deleting the game after most of my must-have mods are transferred.

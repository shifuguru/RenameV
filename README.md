<b>[RENAMEV]</b><br>
A Truly Authentic Vehicle Names Overhaul with Real Life Locations Included<br>
Changes brands and locations to their Real Life counterparts


<b>[DISCLAIMER]</b><br>
It goes without saying that these files are currently in development and to take caution when installing them, that being said I normally only push updates once I've confirmed the version is working, but mistakes do happen! It's a pretty simple mod but some vehicles.meta files have been known to crash the game, patch 3411, avoid this currently. Use the manual method!

<br>

Now for installation, 

I recommendd installing an <a href="https://www.gta5-mods.com/misc/replaced-game-names">official release</a> of the mod before installing the files for your game version, from the <b>__working/LEGACY</b> folder.<br>

<b>[Enhanced]</b><br>
No huge changes really, but with split versions it may get trickier to manage, and updates for Legacy may take longer as priority drops. I will be moving onto Enhanced GTA 5 once modding support arrives for it.

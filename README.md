The Releases tab are only updated every time I am creating a new update to upload to gta5-mods.com, technically it is a misnomer because the 'latest' patch version in the folder may not be ready for release just yet and is a working directory for when I do release the mod.
It goes without saying that these files are currently in development and to take caution with them, that being said I normally only upload to GitHub once I confirm the version is working, but mistakes do happen! 

Now for installation, I would personally go into the _working folder, and download the latest patch folder. 
I'd recommendd installing an official release of the mod, typically the latest release, then overwrite the official mod's files with these ones.
